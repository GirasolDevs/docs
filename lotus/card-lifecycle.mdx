## Card lifecycle

The card lifecycle encompasses several stages, from the initial issuance of the card to its activation, usage, and eventual deactivation or renewal. 

1. **Issuance**: The process begins with the issuance of a new card, which includes designing, printing, and securely delivering the card to the customer.
2. **Activation**: Upon receiving the card, the customer must activate it through a secure process.
3. **Usage**: Once activated, the card can be used for various transactions, including purchases, withdrawals, and payments. This stage includes monitoring for security and managing card limits.
4. **Maintenance**: Throughout the card's active period, it may require maintenance actions such as updating cardholder information, replacing a lost or stolen card, and handling disputes or fraudulent activities.
5. **Renewal or Deactivation**: As the card approaches its expiration date, it can be renewed, or if no longer needed, it can be deactivated.
